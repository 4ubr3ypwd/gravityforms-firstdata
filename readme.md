# Fund Version 1.2!!!

**This plugin is currently not compatible with the latest version of WordPress, Gravity Forms, and First Data, but I'd like to change that!**

I am trying to get a weeks worth of time funded for me to fix this plugin and push out a new release.

Please check out: [http://www.gofundme.com/gffde4](http://www.gofundme.com/gffde4)

# Gravity Forms + First Data Global Gateway e4

**Gravity Forms + First Data Global Gateway e4** is a plugin and addon for
Gravity Forms that will allow you to process products using the
[First Data Global Gateway e4](https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/products/merchants/ecommerce/online-payment-processing.html) service.

You can install this plugin and get more information from [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-first-data-global-gateway-addon).

## How to Debug on Form Submit

To get debug information when a form is submitted, just use
(in `wp-config.php`):

	define('GFFD_DEBUG_FORM_SUBMIT', true);

This will stop Gravity Forms from submitting the entry and show information about the request.
